  # Fix Event Players RLS Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies for event_players table to be more permissive
    - Allow authenticated users to manage event players if they are:
      - Admin, committee, or coach (existing logic)
      - OR the player themselves (for self-management)
      - OR if no specific role restrictions are needed for basic operations

  2. Changes
    - Modify INSERT policy to allow authenticated users
    - Modify UPDATE policy to allow authenticated users  
    - Modify DELETE policy to allow authenticated users
    - Keep SELECT policy as is (already allows authenticated users)

-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow inserting event players" ON event_players;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow updating event players" ON event_players;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow deleting event players" ON event_players;

-- Create more permissive policies for event player management
-- Allow authenticated users to insert event players
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert event players"
  ON event_players
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to update event players
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update event players"
  ON event_players
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete event players
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete event players"
  ON event_players
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Keep the existing SELECT policy as it already works
-- (Allow reading event players for authenticated users)
